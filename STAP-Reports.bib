	abstract = {{NeXus} is an effort by an international group of scientists to define a common data exchange and archival format for neutron, X-ray and muon experiments. {NeXus} is built on top of the scientific data format {HDF}5 and adds domain-specific rules for organizing data within {HDF}5 files, in addition to a dictionary of well defined domain-specific field names. The {NeXus} data format has two purposes. First, it defines a format that can serve as a container for all relevant data associated with a beamline. This is a very important use case. Second, it defines standards in the form of application definitions for the exchange of data between applications. {NeXus} provides structures for raw experimental data as well as for processed data.},

abstract = {The Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS), has been used at a number of sites for performing data acquisition, supervisory control, closed-loop control, sequential control, and operational optimization. The EPICS architecture was originally developed by a group with diverse backgrounds in physics and industrial control. The current architecture represents one instance of the “standard model”. It provides distributed processing and communication from any local area network (LAN) device to the front end controllers. This paper presents the current architecture, performance envelope, current installations, and planned extensions for requirements not met by the current architecture.}
